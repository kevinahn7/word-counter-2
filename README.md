## Description

This program takes in a word and a sentence and then returns how many times the first word appeared in the sentence.

## Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output | Explanation |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Program takes in a phrase | "hello you" | "hello you" | The simplest function would be to take in any phrase
| Program tells you how many times a given word appears in a sentence | "buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo" | 5 | Next it would keep track of how many times words were said
| Program tells you how many times a word appears in a sentence | "You and I, or me and you" | You: 2, And: 2, I: 1, Or: 1, Me: 1  | After that, it should be able to differentiate between different words
| Program tells you how many times a given word appears in a sentence with other words present, regardless of case | "And" "And I swear, by the moon and the stars in the sky" | 2 | Finally, it should be able to target specific words and return the count only for that word
